                <h1>Mehmet Akif Küçükyilmaz</h1>
                <p> I'm 27 years old. I am a Social studies graduate from Akdeniz
                    University. Since my childhood, I have been interested in rapidly
                    developing and computers, that's why I headed to software field. I
                    have developed myself in this field during my studies. I had
                    opportunities to join some events like feats and clubs and i met
                    friends who studied software engineering, computer engineering
                    and I follow news about technology. I have knowledge of disciplines
                    in History, Geography, Law, Economics, Psychology, Logic and many
                    more since Social Science is a multidisciplinary department. I speak
                    English more often because of my personal life. I am developing
                    myself mentally and physically by doing sports. I have discovered my
                    missing talents and i am trying to improve on them. Furthermore, in
                    the emerging technology world, I follow and learn about emerging
                    talents and innovations. I describe myself as well-disciplined,
                    hardworking,suitable for teamwork, fast learner, responsible
                    employee, fast at practical, trustworthy, open to learning and
                    changes, desirous and curious person. Most importantly, i believe
                    imagination is the fuel of man. <strong>My goal is to develop myself in the
                    field of software engineering, create my company, make projects
                    and research on topics such as automation, artificial intelligence
                    and release my games.</strong></p>
